# Linear_Regression
Linear regression project on life expectancy.

This project uses a simple linear regression model to make predictions on life expectancy. The independent variable (i.e. regressor) is the income composition of resources (ICOR) value. 

Python was used to perform analysis, more specifically, the pandas, sci-kit learn, matplotlib and seaborn packages were utilized.  More sophisticated models will most likely yield more accurate results, however, this project is a great starting point for me to grow my knowledge of python and its applications to data analysis. In addition, many unexpected problems arose which the online courses did not prepare me for, for example dealing with unstandardized data. This pushed me to expand my knowledge on data cleaning using functions such as .contains() and str.where() and to tackle the dataset from different angles. This served as a great learning experience and I'm excited to further explore the potential and applications of python for data analysis.
